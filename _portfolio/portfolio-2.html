By clicking in this [repo](https://github.com/AC3510/DYNARE) you will find what consisted in my final project at the Central Bank Summer Course. This contains codes in Dynare and Matlab, which simulate a DSGE model for Peru, specifically a quarterly projection model that seeks to replicate the effect of an adverse supply shock caused by difficult foreign conditions in order to propose a monetary policy response.
