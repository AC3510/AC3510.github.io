I'm an undergraduate student of Economics at PUCP, Peru. My interests are in the fields of Macroeconomics, and Macroeconometrics. I have participated in the summer course of the Central Bank of Peru, in which I have learned about advanced forcasting methods, RBC and DSGE models as well as monetary policy. I'm currently an intern of the business advisory service at Apoyo Consultoria, where I am in responsible for monitoring the labor market and helping in the elaboration of reports on the current economic outlook. Here you will find more about my codes, and soon future projects.
